<p>Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-studies/index.html">Communication Studies</a> in the School of Communication at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>. I am the co-director of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cmmclab">Computational Multimodal Communication Lab</a>, a core faculty in Northwestern's <a href="https://mts.northwestern.edu/">Media, Technology, and Society (MTS)</a> and <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior (TSB)</a> PhD programs, and affiliated with the <a href="https://polcomm.northwestern.edu/">Center for Communication & Public Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.hci.northwestern.edu/">Center for Human-Computer Interaction + Design</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://comm.stanford.edu">Communication at Stanford University</a> in 2023, advised by Professor <a href="http://jenpan.com">Jennifer Pan</a>, where I also earned a Ph.D. minor in <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/">Political Science</a>.</p>

<p>My research focuses on <b>digital technology</b>, <b>political communication</b>, and <b>information manipulation</b> in <b>authoritarian</b> and <b>democratic</b> contexts. My research explores two main questions: <b>How do authoritarian governments use digital technologies to maintain their rule and what are the resulting downstream effects? How do individuals experience visual media and what are the impacts?</b> My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including <i>Political Communication</i>, <i>New Media & Society</i>, <i>Human-Computer Interaction</i>, <i>International Journal of Press/Politics</i>, <i>Mobile Media & Communication</i>, and <i>Computational Communication Research</i>.</p>

<p>As a computational social scientist, my past and ongoing research has focused on advancing computational methods through the development of new frameworks analyzing visual data such as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2024.2317951">images</a> and <a href="https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2022.2.002.LU">videos</a>, the extension of natural language processing methods to analyze <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/19401612221117470">cross-lingual digital communication</a>, and the promotion of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2020.1765914">mixed-method research</a>. In my current projects, I am developing ways of analyzing multimodal data (where visuals, text, and/or audio are combined) to expand our understanding of how propaganda strategies evolve in the digital age, as well as ways of addressing multimodal content in combating information manipulation and social inequality.</p>

<p>I am committed to diverse, equitable, and inclusive education through my teaching and service. I founded <a href="https://yingdanlu.com/account/">COMputation Island (计传岛COMputation)</a>, an online platform of more than 12,000 Mandarin-speaking scholars and students that facilitates the sharing of cutting-edge research in computational social science and the exchange of resources to students and scholars in Asia. I have given invited talks at various U.S. and Asian institutions and have organized panels and preconference at ICA’s annual conferences bringing together scholars around the world to discuss new pathways to integrate computational methods into the advancement of social science theory and analysis. </p>

<p>I obtained my M.A. degree from <a href="https://ceas.stanford.edu/">Center of East Asian Studies</a> at Stanford University and a B.A. degree from the <a href="http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/">School of Journalism and Communication</a> at Tsinghua University. I have interned and worked at <a href="http://www.iccs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsinghua University</a>, <a href="https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/">Japan International Cooperation Agency Research Institute (JICA-RI)</a>, and <a href="https://www.digitalcenter.org/">the Center for the Digital Future</a>.</p>
