Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](http://comm.stanford.edu), advised by Professor [Jennifer Pan](http://jenpan.com). 

My research has been focusing on new media, political communication, and information inequality in authoritarian regimes. I examine research questions like: how do citizens acquire and consume political information on new media? What roles do new media play in authoritarian governance? How do authoritarian governments use the information and communications technology for political propaganda and information control? 

Methodologically, I have been employing different computational methods and utilizing various large datasets to facilitate my research. In particular, my research examines massive textual data such as social media posts and government documents through natural language processing and machine learning methods. Meanwhile, I have extended my research from text to images by applying the [Screenomics](http://screenomics.stanford.edu/) approach, which enables me to analyze media use through millions of moment-by-moment screenshots collected from mobile users in different contexts. 

I obtained my M.A. degree from [Center of East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and a B.A. degree from the [School of Journalism and Communication](http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Larry Diamond and Professor Jianbin Jin. Prior to my Ph.D. study, I have worked as a research intern or visiting scholar at institutes such as [Institute of Contemporary China Studies at Tsinghua University](http://www.iccs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [JICA Research Institute](https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/), and [Center for the Digital Future](https://www.digitalcenter.org/). Besides academia, I have been a journalism intern and public relations intern in China News Agency, Bloomberg Businessweek China, Bayer China, and Ruder Finn Asia.
