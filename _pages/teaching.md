## Teaching Philosophy
Training students to be lifelong active learners and supporting their success in the field of political science is a cornerstone of my academic vocation. To achieve this goal, I have assisted in teaching two courses, delivered five guest lectures, and participated in various mentorship activities. Inspired by my own research, learning, teaching, and mentorship experiences, I have developed my teaching philosophy that incorporates three methodologies: **1) engaging students with interactive learning; 2) creating peer-collaboration environments; and 3) connecting student learning to real-world impacts.**

## Resources
**Getting started with R/RStudio** ([Instruction](/teaching/GetStartedWithR.pdf)) <br /> 
R is a functional open-source programming language widely used in statistical analysis and visualization. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. Similar to any programming language, learning R may not be easy at the beginning, but once you get into it, you can explore more powerful things with R. In this instruction, you will find more details on how to install R and Rstudio, and some useful resources to help you familiarize with R.

**Video-as-Data Research Methods** <br /> 
As video-based social media platforms such as YouTube and TikTok have become a hallmark of today’s social media landscape, the abundant video data and the outperforming persuasive effects of video than text have prompted me to quantitatively analyze large-scale video data. If you are interested in video-as-data research methods, these resources could be helpful:

- [My lecture slides](/teaching/video_as_data.pdf) for "Video-as-Data in Computational Social Science"  <br /> 
- [Replication files](https://github.com/yingdanlu/Douyin_CCR) for "The Pervasive Presence of Chinese Government Content on Douyin Trending Videos" (academic paper published in _Computational Communication Research_; repo includes code for computing video brightness, video color complexity, faces, warm color dominance, and cold color dominance)
