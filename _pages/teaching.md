## Teaching Assistant Experiences

**COMM 1: Introduction to Communication** (Undergraduate lecture; Instructor: Prof. Jeff Hancock)
- Independently taught weekly tutorial sections on communication theories and social media research
- Managed online quizzes, exams, and grading on Canvas
- Feedbacks from my students:<br />
_"Yingdan was great: very knowledgeable and wants her students to be successful in the class."_<br />
_"Yingdan's willingness to model the section based off our feedback was really great. She really tried to make each section the most helpful for us as possible."_<br />
_"Yingdan was always available and willing to answer questions. She always tried her best to make sure we understood the material."_

**COMM 106/206: Communication Research Methods** (Undergraduate/graduate seminar; Instructor: Dr. Anna Gibson)
- Independently taught weekly tutorial sections on R programming and quantitative data analysis
- Mentored student class projects and managed grading on Canvas
- Feedbacks from my students:<br />
_“I think [of Yingdan] as a person to lean on when I didn't know what I was doing."_<br />
_“Yingdan would reply to emails relatively promptly, and this immediacy of feedback/faster access to info helped my learning process."_<br />
_"The R sessions were really helpful, redevelop some of the fundamentals that I had lost over the years."_

## Teaching Resources
**R Programming for Beginners** <br />
R is a functional open-source programming language widely used in statistical analysis and visualization. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. Similar to any programming language, learning R may not be easy at the beginning, but once you get into it, you can explore more powerful things with R. If you are interested in learning R programming, these resources could be helpful:

- [Getting started with R/RStudio](/teaching/GetStartedWithR.pdf): I wrote this instruction for my students in the course _Communication Research Methods_ at Stanford University. In this instruction, you will find more details on how to install R and Rstudio, and some useful resources to help you familiarize with R.
- [R practice code for beginners](https://github.com/yingdanlu/yingdanlu/tree/master/teaching/rbeginners): This code is based on my teaching materials for the course _Communication Research Methods_ at Stanford University. If you are a beginner to R programming, you can run this R code line by line in the R console (bottom left quadrant in R Studio) and learn from setting work directory to creating simple plots.
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html): Swirl is an interactive R package that helps beginners to learn R programming and data science through a fun way. You can install swirl package in your RStudio by following the instructions. By Swirl, you can work through short lessons to start writing R codes.

**Video-as-Data Research Methods** <br /> 
As video-based social media platforms such as YouTube and TikTok have become a hallmark of today’s social media landscape, the abundant video data and the outperforming persuasive effects of video than text have prompted me to quantitatively analyze large-scale video data. If you are interested in video-as-data research methods, these resources could be helpful:

- [My lecture slides](/teaching/video_as_data.pdf) for "Video-as-Data in Computational Social Science" guest lecture: in this lecture, I introduced why and how we can quantitatively analze videos. I used my own research to illustrate how videos can be analyzed frame by frame, and what visual, auditory, and textual features can be extracted from videos. <br /> 
- [Replication files](https://github.com/yingdanlu/Douyin_CCR) for "The Pervasive Presence of Chinese Government Content on Douyin Trending Videos" published in _Computational Communication Research_: This repo includes my code for computing video brightness, video color complexity, faces, warm color dominance, and cold color dominance.


**Books that I Will Recommend** <br />
Here are some books that I would recommend for people who want to systematically learn quantitative social science research and computational social science research:
- [Quantitative social science: An introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691167039/quantitative-social-science): a must-read for every quantitative social scientist.
- [Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207544/text-as-data): a fantastic guide for people who want to learn computational text analysis.
- [Images as Data for Social Science Research: An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Nets for Image Classification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/images-as-data-for-social-science-research/0376EE8A7A21F5B47FC4EC24DF07EFE9): a perfect guide for image-as-data research methods.
- [Research Handbook on Visual Politics](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/research-handbook-on-visual-politics-9781800376922.html): a new research handbook to be published in January 2023. I wrote a book chapter with Yilang Peng on how to use computational visual analysis to study political communication.
