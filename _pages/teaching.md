## Teaching Resources
**R Programming for Beginners** <br />
R is a functional open-source programming language widely used in statistical analysis and visualization. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. Similar to any programming language, learning R may not be easy at the beginning, but once you get into it, you can explore more powerful things with R. If you are interested in learning R programming, these resources could be helpful:

- [Getting started with R/RStudio](/teaching/GetStartedWithR.pdf): I wrote this instruction for my students in the course _Communication Research Methods_ at Stanford University. In this instruction, you will find more details on how to install R and Rstudio, and some useful resources to help you familiarize with R.
- [R practice code for beginners](https://github.com/yingdanlu/yingdanlu/tree/master/teaching/rbeginners): This code is based on my teaching materials for the course _Communication Research Methods_ at Stanford University. If you are a beginner to R programming, you can run this R code line by line in the R console (bottom left quadrant in R Studio) and learn from setting work directory to creating simple plots.
- [Swirl](https://swirlstats.com/students.html): Swirl is an interactive R package that helps beginners to learn R programming and data science through a fun way. You can install swirl package in your RStudio by following the instructions. By Swirl, you can work through short lessons to start writing R codes.
  

**Books that I Will Recommend** <br />
Here are some books that I would recommend for people who want to systematically learn quantitative social science research and computational social science research:
- [Quantitative social science: An introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691167039/quantitative-social-science): a must-read for every quantitative social scientist.
- [Text as Data: A New Framework for Machine Learning and the Social Sciences](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207544/text-as-data): a fantastic guide for people who want to learn computational text analysis.
- [Images as Data for Social Science Research: An Introduction to Convolutional Neural Nets for Image Classification](https://www.cambridge.org/core/elements/images-as-data-for-social-science-research/0376EE8A7A21F5B47FC4EC24DF07EFE9): a perfect guide for image-as-data research methods.
- [Research Handbook on Visual Politics](https://www.e-elgar.com/shop/usd/research-handbook-on-visual-politics-9781800376922.html): a new research handbook including my book chapter with Yilang Peng on how to use computational visual analysis to study political communication.
