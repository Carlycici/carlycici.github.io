**The Institute for International Organization Studies (IIOS)** , affiliated with the School of Government and Public Affairs at the Communication University of China, serves as an academic hub dedicated to cutting-edge research and education on multilateral institutions and global governance.

Our work focuses on three interconnected pillars:
  - Strategic Communication – Examining how international organizations craft narratives and engage stakeholders in an evolving media landscape
  - Media & Global Governance – Investigating the interplay between communication systems and transnational policy-making
  - Global Competency Development – Cultivating next-generation professionals with expertise in cross-cultural communication and multilateral diplomacy
