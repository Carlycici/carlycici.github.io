COMputation Island (计传岛COMputation) is a WeChat-based online community for developing computational communication research (CCR) in China, founded by Yingdan Lu from Stanford University, Yiyan Zhang from Boston University, and Zening Duan from University of Wisconsin-Madison. Starting from January 2021, COMputation Island has created more than 40 original articles to share cutting-edge research, facilitate academic discussions, and promote resource exchanges to more than 10,000 Mandarin-speaking students and scholars in Asia, North America, Europe, and other regions. With the aim of building an influential community of young CCR scholars, COMputation Island also invited prestigious CCR scholars to share their thoughts, experiences, and stories behind their CCR research and trajectories. Some spotlight articles (in Chinese) are listed below:
