Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](http://comm.stanford.edu), advised by Professor [Jennifer Pan](http://jenpan.com). 

My research focuses on new media, political communication, and information manipulation in authoritarian regimes: How is information manipulated and diffused on new media? How do citizens consume political information and encounter information manipulation on new media? What roles do new media play in authoritarian governance? How do authoritarian governments use information and communications technology for political propaganda and information control? My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals including <i>Political Communication</i> and <i>Human-Computer Interaction</i>. 

Methodologically, I employ various computational methods and large datasets to facilitate my research. In particular, my research examines massive textual data such as social media posts and government documents through natural language processing and machine learning methods. Meanwhile, I have extended my research from text to images by applying the [Screenomics](http://screenomics.stanford.edu/) approach, which enables me to analyze media use through millions of moment-by-moment screenshots collected from mobile users in different contexts. 

I obtained my M.A. degree from [Center of East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and a B.A. degree from the [School of Journalism and Communication](http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Larry Diamond and Professor Jianbin Jin, respectively. Prior to my Ph.D. study, I have worked as a research intern or visiting scholar at institutes such as [Institute of Contemporary China Studies at Tsinghua University](http://www.iccs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [JICA Research Institute](https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/), and [Center for the Digital Future](https://www.digitalcenter.org/). Besides academia, I have been a journalism intern and public relations intern in China News Agency, Bloomberg Businessweek China, Bayer China, and Ruder Finn Asia.
