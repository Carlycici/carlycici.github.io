Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; I am an Assistant Professor of [Communication Studies](https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-studies/index.html) in the School of Communication at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I am the co-director of the [Computational Multimodal Communication Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/cmmclab), a core faculty in Northwestern's [Media, Technology, and Society (MTS)](https://mts.northwestern.edu/) and [Technology and Social Behavior (TSB)](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) PhD programs, and affiliated with the [Center for Communication & Public Policy](https://polcomm.northwestern.edu/) and [Center for Human-Computer Interaction + Design](https://www.hci.northwestern.edu/). 

My research focuses on **digital technology**, **political communication**, and **information manipulation** in **authoritarian** and **democratic** contexts, focusing on two areas: **digital technologies and information manipulation in authoritarian politics** and **multimodal communication in AI-mediated environments** My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>Political Communication</i>, <i>New Media & Society</i>, <i>Human-Computer Interaction</i>, <i>International Journal of Press/Politics</i>, and among other peer-reviewed journals.

As a computational social scientist, my past and ongoing research has focused on advancing computational methods through the development of new frameworks analyzing multimodal data such as [images](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2024.2317951) and [videos](https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2022.2.002.LU), the extension of natural language processing methods to analyze [cross-lingual digital communication](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2420607122), and the promotion of [mixed-method research](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2020.1765914). 

I received my Ph.D. in [Communication at Stanford University](http://comm.stanford.edu) in 2023, advised by Professor [Jennifer Pan](http://jenpan.com), where I also earned a Ph.D. minor in [Political Science](https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/), and a M.A. degree from [Center of East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/). I obtained my B.A. degree from the [School of Journalism and Communication](http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University.
