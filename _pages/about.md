Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Department of Communication at Stanford University](http://comm.stanford.edu), advised by Professor [Jennifer Pan](http://jenpan.com). I am currently on the job market.

My research focuses on **digital media**, **political communication**, and **global communication**. As a **computational social scientist** and a **mixed-method researcher**, I use **large-scale digital data** and **cutting-edge computational methods** like computer vision, along with **qualitative methods** such as ethnography into the advancement of social scientific theory and analysis. My research explores two important questions: **<i>How do authoritarian governments like China use digital media and technology strategically to maintain their rule and what are the resulting downstream effects? How do individuals experience digital technology and what are the impacts?</i>** My work has been published in peer-reviewed journals, including <i>Political Communication</i>, <i>Human-Computer Interaction</i>, <i>International Journal of Press/Politics</i>, <i>Mobile Media & Communication</i>, <i>Computational Communication Research</i>, and <i>Journal of Quantitative Description: Digital Media</i>.

My first line of research uses digital data to explore the roles of digital media and technology in authoritarian governance, with a special focus on how the Chinese government strategically leverages social media for political propaganda. In two publications, I apply computational text analyses to large-scale social media data to identify new propaganda strategies used by the Chinese government. 

Under the second research line, I explore the online diffusion of misinformation and the presence of digital inequality in multiple national and platform settings. My ongoing projects examine how misinformation is structured in multimedia format, how multimodal features of fact-checking videos affect perceptions and engagement, and how wealth inequality exists among social media influencers.

Methodologically, I employ various computational methods and massive multimedia datasets to facilitate my research. In particular, my research examines massive textual data such as social media posts and government documents through natural language processing and machine learning methods. I have also extended my research from text to visual data, for which I apply computer vision techniques and combine analysis of video, text, and meta-data to facilitate quantitative analysis on massive video datasets. Meanwhile, by combining the [Screenomics](http://screenomics.stanford.edu/) approach and unsupervised machine learning, I can analyze media use through millions of moment-by-moment screenshots collected from mobile users in different contexts. 

I obtained my M.A. degree from [the Center of East Asian Studies](https://ceas.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and a B.A. degree from the [School of Journalism and Communication](http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Larry Diamond and Professor Jianbin Jin, respectively. Prior to my Ph.D. study, I have worked as a research intern or visiting scholar at institutes such as [Institute of Contemporary China Studies at Tsinghua University](http://www.iccs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [JICA Research Institute](https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/), and [Center for the Digital Future](https://www.digitalcenter.org/). Besides academia, I have been a journalism intern and public relations intern in China News Agency, Bloomberg Businessweek China, Bayer China, and Ruder Finn Asia.
