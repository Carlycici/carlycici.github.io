* <b>Abstract</b>: The proliferation of social media and digital technologies has made it necessary for governments to expand their focus beyond propaganda content in order to disseminate propaganda effectively. We identify a strategy of using clickbait to increase the visibility of political propaganda. We show that such a strategy is used across China by combining ethnography with a computational analysis of a novel dataset of the titles of 197,303 propaganda posts made by 213 Chinese city-level governments on WeChat. We find that Chinese propagandists face intense pressures to demonstrate their effectiveness on social media because their work is heavily quantified–measured, analyzed, and ranked–with metrics such as views and likes. Propagandists use both clickbait and non-propaganda content (e.g., lifestyle tips) to capture clicks, but rely more heavily on clickbait because it does not decrease space available for political propaganda. Government propagandists use clickbait at a rate commensurate with commercial and celebrity social media accounts. The use of clickbait is associated with more views and likes, as well as greater reach of government propaganda outlets and messages. These results reveal how the advertising-based business model and affordances of social media influence political propaganda and how government strategies to control information are moving beyond censorship, propaganda, and disinformation.

* <b>Abstract</b>: Digital experiences capture an increasingly large part of life, making them a preferred, if not required, method to describe and theorize about human behavior. Digital media also shape behavior by enabling people to switch between different content easily, and create unique threads of experiences that pass quickly through numerous information categories. Current methods of recording digital experiences provide only partial reconstructions of digital lives that weave – often within seconds – among multiple applications, locations, functions, and media. We describe an end-to-end system for capturing and analyzing the “screenome” of life in media, i.e., the record of individual experiences represented as a sequence of screens that people view and interact with over time. The system includes software that collects screenshots, extracts text and images, and allows searching of a screenshot database. We discuss how the system can be used to elaborate current theories about psychological processing of technology, and suggest new theoretical questions that are enabled by multiple timescale analyses. Capabilities of the system are highlighted with eight research examples that analyze screens from adults who have generated data within the system. We end with a discussion of future uses, limitations, theory, and privacy.

## Working Papers / Selected Works in Progress
"<b>Homogenized and Localized: A Comparison of
Moment-by-moment Changes in Smartphone Use in Diverse Contexts,"</b> with Daniel Muise, Jennifer Pan, and Byron Reeves (Stanford University), <i>R&R</i>
* <b>Abstract</b>: Smartphone devices give their users a newfound mastery over how they engage with media. Communication research offers two sets of theories for how society adapts to this new development. According to theories of localization, the diversity of smartphone usage behavior will reflect the diversity of pre-existing groups. According to theories of homogenization, the standardization of the smartphone interface will produce homogeneous behavior across all users. We theorize that homogenization and localization can occur simultaneously, as revealed by focusing on the temporal and visual structure of smartphone usage, rather than comparing on-screen content choices. We empirically demonstrate this using unique, longitudinal smartphone screenshot records collected at five-second intervals in the U.S., Myanmar, and China. Behaviors most directly influenced by local norms and resources—e.g., the total amount of time spent on the smartphone—are local to groups, while behaviors more related to the interface —e.g., how long one smartphone usage session lasts—are similar across groups. 


"<b>Public Attitudes on Sina Weibo in the Early Days of COVID-19,"</b> with Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu (Stanford University), <i>Under Review</i>. ([SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3757135))
* <b>Abstract</b>: Previous research has argued that exogenous shocks such as natural disasters threaten government stability. When the novel coronavirus outbreak first emerged in China, some commentators predicted that public anger would threaten the Chinese regime. By analyzing over five million original posts from Sina Weibo between December 2019 and February 2020, we find that online criticism spiked when the Chinese government announced the Wuhan lockdown, when controversies around medical supplies surfaced, and when Dr. Li Wenliang died of the disease. However, we also observe nearly parallel bursts of support for the regime during the Wuhan lockdown and death of Dr. Li Wenliang. We find no evidence of large-scale censorship of criticism. Although we cannot rule out government efforts to artificially generate approval, the support we observe is likely, at least in part, organic. These results caution against over-simplification of online public opinion in authoritarian countries and highlight a need for more precise and systematic measurement of public opinion on social media.
