## Working Papers / Selected Works in Progress
"<b>Homogenized and Localized: A Comparison of
Moment-by-moment Changes in Smartphone Use in Diverse Contexts,"</b> with Daniel Muise, Jennifer Pan, and Byron Reeves (Stanford University), <i>R&R
* <b>Abstract</b>: Smartphone devices give their users a newfound mastery over how they engage with media. Communication research offers two sets of theories for how society adapts to this new development. According to theories of localization, the diversity of smartphone usage behavior will reflect the diversity of pre-existing groups. According to theories of homogenization, the standardization of the smartphone interface will produce homogeneous behavior across all users. We theorize that homogenization and localization can occur simultaneously, as revealed by focusing on the temporal and visual structure of smartphone usage, rather than comparing on-screen content choices. We empirically demonstrate this using unique, longitudinal smartphone screenshot records collected at five-second intervals in the U.S., Myanmar, and China. Behaviors most directly influenced by local norms and resources—e.g., the total amount of time spent on the smartphone—are local to groups, while behaviors more related to the interface —e.g., how long one smartphone usage session lasts—are similar across groups.

"<b>Public Attitudes on Sina Weibo in the Early Days of COVID-19,"</b> with Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu (Stanford University), <i>Under Review</i>. ([SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3757135))
* <b>Abstract</b>: Previous research has argued that exogenous shocks such as natural disasters threaten government stability. When the novel coronavirus outbreak first emerged in China, some commentators predicted that public anger would threaten the Chinese regime. By analyzing over five million original posts from Sina Weibo between December 2019 and February 2020, we find that online criticism spiked when the Chinese government announced the Wuhan lockdown, when controversies around medical supplies surfaced, and when Dr. Li Wenliang died of the disease. However, we also observe nearly parallel bursts of support for the regime during the Wuhan lockdown and death of Dr. Li Wenliang. We find no evidence of large-scale censorship of criticism. Although we cannot rule out government efforts to artificially generate approval, the support we observe is likely, at least in part, organic. These results caution against over-simplification of online public opinion in authoritarian countries and highlight a need for more precise and systematic measurement of public opinion on social media.
